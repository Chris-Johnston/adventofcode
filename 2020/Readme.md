# 2020, _that_ year

In 2019 I made a plan to learn rust by doing advent of code, but there were a few days where
I fell back to Python to solve a problem.

This year I was stronger on my committment, and have done everything using rust. (Day 1 has a graph generated with py matplotlib.)
I used a boilerplate project (in the `template` dir) which I copied for each of the new days
which handled the typical file and test case stuff.

I think my understanding of rust is stronger this time around. One thing that I think I would have liked to have
done differently is how I handled test cases. I think I would have liked to set up a more robust TDD pattern
instead of assert statements in my main method.

Days 0-15 have solutions for parts 1-2.
Day 16 was the first day that I started to fall behind with other things getting in the way.
Day 17 has a partial solution for part 1 that doesn't work. Couldn't figure it out after
some time, and so I left it on the table.
